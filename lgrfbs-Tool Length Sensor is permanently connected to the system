Tested with an Noname China CNC 3040 + CNC Tool Length Sensor from cnc-plus.de  
If the Tool Length Sensor is permanently connected to the system, the lines [MachMsg("Attach clip to tool.", "WARNING!!", 0)] 
can be disabled with a ' character and "Sleep 1000" added to the line below. 

Thanks for a great script and good instructions to get it started.
